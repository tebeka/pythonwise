This is a demo on how to quickly create OS X (Mac) application using the
bundled Python.

We use the browser as GUI (Desktop Web Application) and create an
"Application Bundle" which is just a directory that ends with .app and has a
certain structure.

At the end we create a ZIP file with the application bundle in it, ready for
distribution. I still need to find a good way to create a .dmg (mkisofs
don't cut it).

Most of the information about application bundles I got from
http://tinyurl.com/yh3bh2h and http://tinyurl.com/yf7rqow.
